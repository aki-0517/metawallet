# 1. Cross-Chain Interoperability & Asset Movement

Judging Criteria

Drive solutions for effortless movement and management of assets or identities across multiple blockchains with a seamless user experience.

Applications that enable DeFi transactions, NFT transfers, or user authentication across several chains, including Solana and EVMs. Embedded wallets should abstract away complexity, enabling users to access and move assets or data wherever they want.

Possible Directions:
- Cross-chain DeFi (liquidity routing, yield farming, instant swaps)
- NFT or token bridges connecting Solana and EVM ecosystems
- Universal multi-chain logins and identity management
- Dashboards displaying assets/status across multiple blockchains

# 2. Solana Everyday Impact: Consumer & Community App

Judging Criteria

Showcase how Solana’s performance and Web3Auth’s embedded wallets make everyday web experiences (like social platforms, creator tools, or local commerce) more democratic, private, and user-empowering.

Consumer applications where end-users own their data, monetize content, or interact with communities in new ways using seamless wallet onboarding and Solana’s scalability. The focus is on practical use, privacy, and real-world value for non-crypto natives.

Possible Directions:

Decentralized social networks with user content ownership

Mobile/web event ticketing employing wallet-based QR access

Peer-to-peer tipping, social rewards, or creator payments

Secure, private messaging or sharing platforms

# 3. Programmable Commerce & DeFi for Everyone

Judging Criteria

Unlock programmable, automated, and accessible financial tools for the mainstream democratizing complex DeFi and commerce protocols.

User-centric DeFi or commerce solutions that make automation (bill splitting, recurring payments, dynamic rewards) simple and transparent. Projects should leverage embedded wallets for onboarding and ongoing asset management.

Possible Directions:
- Automated bill splitting or group payments for friends, families, clubs
- Subscription services or pay-per-use APIs/paywalls
- “One-click” DeFi aggregators simplifying asset allocation and strategies
- Community finance tools: micro-lending, pooled savings, dynamic rewards

# 4. Best Use of SNS

Judging Criteria

Awards the most creative or practical use of the Solana Name Service (SNS) in your project



# Qualification Requirements
The app should have integrated the MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDKs (Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs) and use social/email login for instant, seedless wallet creation and management.

The dApp should be deployed on the Solana blockchain. If opting for the cross chain track, it should be Solana + any other chain.

Use any of the following SDKs based on your platform:

Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDK: React, Vue or JavaScript SDKs

Web3Auth Plug and Play Mobile SDKs: Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter

Web3Auth Plug and Play Gaming SDKs: Unity, Unreal

The demo should have a working MetaMask Embedded Wallet integration depicted in the main flow of the application.
