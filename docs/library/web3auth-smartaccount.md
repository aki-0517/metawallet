Smart Accounts
Effortlessly create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a few lines of code, using our Smart Account feature. Smart accounts offer enhanced control and programmability, enabling powerful features that traditional wallets can't provide.

Key features of Smart Accounts include:

Gas Abstraction: Cover transaction fees for users, or allow users to pay for their own transactions using ERC-20 tokens.
Batch Transactions: Perform multiple transactions in a single call.
Automated Transactions: Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH hits a specific price.
Custom Spending Limits: Allow users to set tailored spending limits.
For more information about ERC-4337 and its components, check out our detailed blog post.

Our smart account integration streamlines your setup, allowing you to create and manage smart accounts using your favorite libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Wagmi. You don't need to rely on third-party packages to effortlessly create ERC-4337 compatible Smart Contract Wallets (SCWs), giving users the ability to perform batch transactions and efficiently manage gas sponsorship.

note
This is a paid feature and the minimum pricing plan to use this SDK in a production environment is the Growth Plan. You can use this feature in Web3Auth Sapphire Devnet network for free.

Enabling Smart Accounts
prerequisite
To enable this feature, you need to configure Smart Accounts from your project in the Web3Auth Developer Dashboard.

Dashboard Configuration
To enable Smart Accounts, navigate to the Smart Accounts section in the Web3Auth dashboard, and enable the "Set up Smart Accounts" toggle. Web3Auth currently supports MetaMaskSmartAccount as a Smart Account provider.

Enable Smart Accounts

Wallet Configuration
Once Smart Accounts are enabled, you can customize the wallet configurations:

All supported wallets (default): Allows users to create Smart Accounts using both embedded and external wallets.
Embedded wallets only: Restricts Smart Account creation to only embedded wallets.
Configure Bundler & Paymaster
A bundler aggregates UserOperations and submits them on-chain via the global EntryPoint contract. To configure the bundler:

Configure Bundler &amp; Paymaster

Navigate to the Bundler & Paymaster tab within the Smart Accounts section
Add the bundler URL for each supported chain
Add the paymaster URL for each supported chain
info
Currently, the sponsored paymaster can only be configured via the dashboard. For ERC-20 paymaster, refer to the SDK Configuration section below.

SDK Configuration [Optional]
While the dashboard provides a convenient way to configure Smart Accounts, the SDK offers greater flexibility by allowing you to override these settings.

Basic Configuration
To enable Smart Accounts in your application, add the accountAbstractionConfig to your Web3Auth options:

import { WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_DEVNET,
  accountAbstractionConfig: {
    smartAccountType: "metamask",
    chains: [
      {
        chainId: "0x1",
        bundlerConfig: {
          url: "YOUR_BUNDLER_URL",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};


Advanced Configuration: Override Paymaster Context
You can override the paymaster context defined in the dashboard for specific chains. This is particularly useful when your paymaster requires custom settings or parameters.

import { WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_DEVNET,
  accountAbstractionConfig: {
    smartAccountType: "metamask",
    chains: [
      {
        chainId: "0x1",
        bundlerConfig: {
          url: "YOUR_BUNDLER_URL",
          // This is just an example of how you can configure the paymaster context.
          // Please refer to the documentation of the paymaster you are using
          // to understand the required parameters.
          paymasterContext: {
            token: "SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
            sponsorshipPolicyId: "sp_my_policy_id",
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};


info
The paymaster context must be manually configured for each chain that needs to be supported.

Using Smart Accounts
Configure Signer
The Web3Auth Smart Account feature is compatible with popular signer SDKs, including wagmi, ethers, and viem. You can choose your preferred package to configure the signer.

You can retreive the provider to configure the signer from Web3Auth instance.

Wagmi
Wagmi does not require any special configuration to use the signer with smart accounts. Once you have set up your Web3Auth provider and connected your wallet, Wagmi's hooks (such as useSigner or useAccount) will automatically use the smart account as the signer. You can interact with smart accounts using Wagmi just like you would with a regular EOA (Externally Owned Account) signerâ€”no additional setup is needed.

Viem
Ethers
import { createWalletClient } from "viem";

// Use your Web3Auth instance to retreive the provider.
const provider = web3auth.provider;

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  transport: custom(provider),
});


Get Smart Account Address
Once the signers or Wagmi configuration is set up, it can be used to retrieve the user's Smart Account address.

Viem
Ethers
Wagmi
// Use walletClient instance from previous step
const addresses = await walletClient.getAddresses();

const smartAccountAddress = addresses[0];
const eoaAddress = addresses[1];


Send Transaction
Developers can use their preferred signer or Wagmi hooks to initiate on-chain transactions, while Web3Auth manages the creation and submission of the UserOperation. Only the to, data, and value fields need to be provided. Any additional parameters will be ignored and automatically overridden.

To ensure reliable execution, the bundler client sets maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas values. If custom values are required, developers can use the Viem's BundlerClient to manually construct and send the user operation.

Since Smart Accounts are deployed smart contracts, the user's first transaction also triggers the on-chain deployment of their wallet.

Viem
Ethers
Wagmi
// Convert 1 ether to WEI format
const amount = parseEther("1");

// Submits a user operation to the blockchain
const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
  to: "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
  value: amount,
  // This will perform the transfer of ETH
  data: "0x",
});

// Wait for the transaction to be mined
const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });


Sign Transaction
You can sign a transaction without immediately sending it. For the user's first transaction, the UserOperation calldata will automatically include the deployment data needed to create the Smart Account on-chain.

info
Wagmi doesn't have hooks for signing transactions yet.

Viem
Ethers
// Convert 1 ether to WEI format
const amount = parseEther("1");
const addresses = await walletClient.getAddresses();

const request = await walletClient.prepareTransactionRequest({
  account: addresses[0],
  to: "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
  value: amount,
});

const signature = await walletClient.signTransaction(request as any);


Sign Message
Smart Accounts support message signing following the EIP-1271 standard for signature verification, using the isValidSignature method defined in the smart contract wallet instead of the ecrecover function used by EOAs.

Viem
Ethers
Wagmi
const originalMessage = "YOUR_MESSAGE";

const addresses = await walletClient.getAddresses();

const signedMessage = await walletClient.signMessage({
  account: address[0],
  message: originalMessage,
});


Send Batch Transaction
One of the key advantages of Smart Accounts is the ability to execute multiple operations in a single transaction. For example, instead of requiring separate transactions for token approval and then swapping, both operations can be combined into a single UserOperation.

To perform batch transactions, you must use the BundlerClient provided by Web3Auth:

// Use your Web3Auth instance
const accountAbstractionProvider = web3auth.accountAbstractionProvider;
// Use the same accountAbstractionProvider we created earlier.
const bundlerClient = accountAbstractionProvider.bundlerClient!;
const smartAccount = accountAbstractionProvider.smartAccount!;

// 0.00001 ETH in WEI format
const amount = 10000000000000n;

const userOpHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
  account: smartAccount,
  calls: [
    {
      to: "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
      value: amount,
      data: "0x",
    },
    {
      to: "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
      value: amount,
      data: "0x",
    },
  ],
});

// Retrieve user operation receipt
const receipt = await bundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
  hash: userOpHash,
});

const transactionHash = receipt.receipt.transactionHash;


info
When calling sendUserOperation, it returns a UserOperation hash, not the transaction hash. To get the final transaction details, use waitForUserOperationReceipt.

Send Transaction Using ERC-20 Paymaster
You can use ERC-20 tokens to pay for transaction fees instead of the native token (e.g., ETH). This requires approving the token for use by the paymaster:

// Use your Web3Auth instance
const accountAbstractionProvider = web3auth.accountAbstractionProvider;

// Use the same accountAbstractionProvider we created earlier.
const bundlerClient = accountAbstractionProvider.bundlerClient!;
const smartAccount = accountAbstractionProvider.smartAccount!;

// Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster address
const pimlicoPaymasterAddress = "0x0000000000000039cd5e8aE05257CE51C473ddd1";

// USDC address on Ethereum Sepolia
const usdcAddress = "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238";

// 0.00001 ETH in WEI format
const amount = 10000000000000n;

// 10 USDC in WEI format. Since USDC has 6 decimals, 10 * 10^6
const approvalAmount = 10000000n;

const userOpHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
  account: smartAccount,
  calls: [
    // Approve USDC on Sepolia chain for Pimlico's ERC 20 Paymaster
    {
      to: usdcAddress,
      abi: parseAbi(["function approve(address,uint)"]),
      functionName: "approve",
      args: [pimlicoPaymasterAddress, approvalAmount],
    },
    {
      to: "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
      value: amount,
      data: "0x",
    },
    {
      to: "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
      value: amount,
      data: "0x",
    },
  ],
});

// Retrieve user operation receipt
const receipt = await bundlerClient.waitForUserOperationReceipt({
  hash: userOpHash,
});

const transactionHash = receipt.receipt.transactionHash;
